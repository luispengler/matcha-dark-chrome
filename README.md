# Introduction
This theme was inspired by the Matcha-Dark-Sea theme that I created for Manjaro Xfce. I hope you like it!


To add it to your chrome or chrome based browser, you need to enable developer mode, then simply drag the .crx file into the extension page.

Obs: This was my first project ever made, I uploaded it in October 4th, 2020.
